## Background 
I created a tool to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet. I begin first by creating a map that showed all the earthquakes in the last 7 days.  Each location is mearesed by the depth of each earthquake and provides the location, date and time, magnitude, and depth. Next, I mapped the fault line to give furtehr insight to the relationship between earthquakes and falut lines. Lastly, I added different bases maps to help with viziulations.
