# leaflet-challenge

## Background 
I created a tool to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations on issues facing our planet. I began by creating a map showing all the earthquakes in the last 7 days.  Each location is measured by the earthquake's depth and provides the location, date and time, magnitude, and depth. Next, I mapped the fault line to give further insight into the relationship between earthquakes and fault lines. Lastly, I added different base maps to help with vizulations.
